          The <b>Flower of Bangladesh</b> reflects the country’s natural beauty
          and rich biodiversity. The <b>national flower of Bangladesh</b> is the
          <b>Shapla</b>, or water lily (Nymphaea nouchali), a stunning aquatic
          blossom found floating gracefully in ponds, lakes, and wetlands across
          the country. Its soft pink or white petals spread widely over green
          lily pads, creating a serene and poetic landscape. The
          <b>Shapla</b> is not only admired for its beauty but also
          <b>symbolizes purity and peace</b> in Bangladeshi culture. It blooms
          mostly during the rainy season, bringing a calming presence to the
          countryside. Alongside the shapla, Bangladesh is home to many other
          special flowers that add color and fragrance to its natural
          environment. One of the most beloved flowers is the
          <b>Krishnachura</b> (Delonix regia), known for its fiery red-orange
          blooms that cover the trees during summer, turning roadsides into
          vibrant canvases of color. Its blooming season is eagerly awaited each
          year. The <b>Sheuli</b> flower, small and white with an orange stalk,
          blossoms mainly in autumn and is often associated with religious
          rituals and early morning fragrances. It releases a gentle, sweet
          smell that fills the air and brings a sense of freshness and
          nostalgia. <b>Rajanigandha</b> (tuberose), popular for its strong and
          captivating fragrance, is often used in weddings and ceremonies. Its
          long stems with clusters of white flowers bloom beautifully at night.
          The <b>Beliphool</b> (jasmine) is another popular flower in
          Bangladesh, known for its intense, sweet scent and delicate white
          petals. It is often used in making garlands and for personal
          adornment. Together, these flowers—through their beauty, fragrance,
          and presence in daily life—create a vivid portrait of Bangladesh’s
          floral heritage. Whether blooming in the wild, growing in home
          gardens, or used in festivals, the flowers of Bangladesh capture the
          soul of the land.

                  Krishnachura, known as the Flame Tree or Royal Poinciana, is
                  one of the most beloved and vibrant flowers in Bengal. With
                  its fiery red and orange blossoms, it transforms the summer
                  landscape into a burst of color. Blooming mainly from April to
                  June, Krishnachura symbolizes passion, beauty, and the spirit
                  of Bengali summer. Its large umbrella-shaped canopy provides
                  shade and charm to roadsides, schoolyards, and parks. Though
                  not native to Bengal, it has become deeply rooted in Bengali
                  culture, poetry, and memory, often associated with childhood
                  nostalgia and romanticism. Krishnachura is truly a visual
                  celebration of nature in Bengal.

                  Sheuli, also known as Night-flowering Jasmine or *Parijat*, is
                  a beloved Bengali flower that holds deep cultural and
                  spiritual significance. Blooming in the early hours of autumn,
                  especially during the time of Durga Puja, its small white
                  petals with orange stems spread a sweet, delicate fragrance.
                  Sheuli flowers fall gently to the ground at dawn, creating a

                  offered in prayers and used in festive decorations. Associated
