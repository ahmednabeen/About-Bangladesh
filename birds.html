          <b>The birds of Bangladesh</b> are living jewels of its
          <b>natural landscape</b>, filling the air with vibrant colors,
          enchanting melodies, and a sense of <b>harmony</b> that
          <b>echoes</b> the country's deep-rooted connection with <b>nature</b>.
          At the heart of this avian symphony is the <b>national bird</b>, the
          Oriental <b>Magpie-Robin</b>—locally known as the
          <b>Doyel</b>—celebrated for its sweet, <b>flute-like song</b> and seen
          as a <b>symbol of joy</b>, resilience, and the poetic spirit of the
          Bangladeshi people. From the misty forests of <b>Sylhet</b> and the
          <b>hilly terrains of Chittagong</b> to the vast wetlands of
          <b>Hakaluki Haor</b> and the mysterious <b>Sundarbans</b>, more than
          <b>700 bird</b> species grace the skies, trees, and rivers. Graceful
          <b>Kingfishers</b> dive into clear waters, vibrant Green Bee-eaters
          dart through the air, and elegant Openbill Storks wade through
          marshes, each playing a crucial role in <b>pollination</b>, seed
          dispersal, and natural pest control. During <b>Winter</b>, the arrival
          of migratory <b>guests like Siberian ducks</b> and
          <b>bar-headed geese</b> transforms the wetlands into magical
          landscapes of fluttering wings and echoing calls. Birds such as the
          regal Brahminy Kite or the iridescent Purple Sunbird aren’t just
          ecological assets—they are muses of art, folklore, and song, embodying
          beauty and freedom. In <b>rural life</b>, birds serve as
          <b>natural clocks</b> and <b>seasonal markers</b>, binding everyday
          routines to the <b>rhythm of nature</b>. <b>Celebrations</b> like
          <b>bird festivals</b> and conservation efforts reflect a growing
          <b>awareness</b> to protect these winged wonders from habitat loss and
          <b>environmental threats</b>. Altogether, the birds of Bangladesh are
          more than just creatures of flight—they are <b>symbols of balance</b>,
          beauty, and the vibrant soul of a nation where nature and culture soar
          together.

                  The Oriental Magpie-Robin, or Doyel, Bangladesh’s national
                  bird, is a striking black-and-white songbird with a melodious,
                  flute-like call, symbolizing joy and resilience. Found in
                  gardens, forests, and urban areas across Sylhet to Chittagong,
                  it thrives in diverse habitats. It feeds on insects, worms,
                  and small fruits, often foraging on the ground. Known for its
                  bold personality and territorial displays, the Doyel is a
                  skilled mimic, enchanting listeners with varied songs. These
                  birds typically live 3-5 years in the wild. Conservation
                  efforts protect them from habitat loss, ensuring their vibrant
                  presence endures.

                <p class="card-text">
                  The House Sparrow, known as "Charai" in Bangladesh, is a
                  small, lively bird common across urban and rural areas. It
                  thrives in human settlements, nesting in roof crevices, trees,
                  or building gaps. Feeding on seeds, grains, insects, and food
                  scraps, it adapts easily to diverse environments. Its chirpy
                  calls and social nature make it a familiar sight, often seen
                  in flocks. House Sparrows are resilient, with a lifespan of
                  3-5 years, though some live longer. Their adaptability and
                  close association with human habitats make them a cherished
                  part of Bangladesh’s avian landscape, despite declining
                  populations globally.

                  The Black Francolin (Francolinus francolinus), a rare resident
                  of Bangladesh, is a medium-sized gamebird in the pheasant
                  family, known locally as kaala teetar. Found in tall grasses,
                  farmlands, and scrublands near water in Chittagong, Dhaka, and
                  Rajshahi divisions, it forages on seeds, grains, shoots,
                  berries, and insects like termites. This shy, terrestrial bird
                  is active at dawn and dusk, producing a distinctive
                  “cheek-keraykek” call. Monogamous, it nests in ground
                  depressions, laying 6-9 eggs. Its lifespan is around 5-8
                  years. Threats include habitat loss and hunting.

                  The Common Myna (Acridotheres tristis), known as Shalik in
                  Bangladesh, is a widespread bird thriving in urban areas,
                  farmlands, and open woodlands. Omnivorous, it eats insects,
                  fruits, seeds, and human food scraps, often foraging on the
                  ground. Its distinctive brown body, black head, and yellow
                  beak make it recognizable. Noted for mimicking human speech
                  and varied vocalizations, it’s a skilled communicator. Mynas
                  are social, roosting in large flocks and nesting in tree holes
                  or buildings. They live about 4 years in the wild, sometimes
                  reaching 12. Their adaptability makes them a common sight
                  across Bangladesh.

                  The Green Peafowl (Pavo muticus), once found in southeastern
                  Bangladesh, is now extinct there due to habitat loss and
                  hunting. These large birds inhabit tropical forests,
                  grasslands, and farmland edges, preferring areas near water.
                  They are omnivorous, eating fruits, invertebrates, small
                  reptiles, and plants. Known for their iridescent bluish-green
                  plumage and long tails, both sexes look similar, unlike Indian
                  Peafowl. They roost in trees at night and forage on the ground
                  during the day. Their lifespan averages 15 years in the wild,
                  longer in captivity. Conservation efforts are crucial for this
                  endangered species.

                  The White-bellied Sea Eagle, a majestic bird of prey in
                  Bangladesh, inhabits coastal areas, estuaries, and inland
                  wetlands like those in the Sundarbans. It primarily feeds on
                  fish, sea snakes, and occasionally birds and mammals, often
                  stealing food from other birds. This opportunistic piscivore
                  uses its sharp, curved talons to snatch prey from water. With
                  a wingspan up to 2.2 meters, it soars over waterways, nesting
                  in tall trees or cliffs. It lives up to 30 years, breeding in
                  monogamous pairs. Though globally Least Concern, habitat loss
                  threatens its population in Bangladesh.

                  The White-breasted Waterhen (Amaurornis phoenicurus), known as
                  "Dahuk" in Bangladesh, is a common waterbird found in marshes,
                  ponds, and ditches. It inhabits wetlands, rice fields, and
                  gardens, often near water, and is less secretive than other
                  rails. Its diet includes insects, small fish, mollusks, seeds,
                  and vegetable matter. This bird is known for loud, croaky
                  calls during the breeding season (June-October). It builds
                  shallow nests in marsh vegetation, laying 6-7 eggs. The
                  White-breasted Waterhen is monogamous and adaptable, with a
                  lifespan of about 5-10 years. Its population is stable, listed
                  as Least Concern.

                  well-wooded areas, often near water or human settlements. This
                  medium-sized owl, about 30-36 cm long, is nocturnal, roosting
                  in shady branches during the day. It feeds on large insects,
                  frogs, lizards, small birds, and mice, hunting from exposed
                  perches at dusk. Its distinctive call is a soft, musical

                  species is adaptable, with a lifespan of about 10-15 years.
                  Its conservation status is Least Concern.

                <p class="card-text">
                  The Baya Weaver (Ploceus philippinus), a small bird native to
                  Bangladesh, is renowned for its intricately woven,
                  retort-shaped nests built by males during the monsoon season.
                  These sparrow-sized birds live in flocks in grasslands,
                  farmlands, and wetlands, often nesting on thorny trees or over
                  water to avoid predators. Their diet is mainly granivorous,
                  consisting of seeds and grains, supplemented by insects, small
                  frogs, and mollusks. Known for their polygynous mating, males
                  build multiple nests to attract females. Their lifespan is
                  approximately 10-15 years, though habitat loss threatens in
                  Bangladesh.

                  The White-rumped Shama (Copsychus malabaricus), a melodious
                  songbird, thrives in Bangladesh’s forests and woodlands.
                  Preferring dense undergrowth, it avoids human settlements,
                  favoring shady thickets. This shy, territorial bird feeds
                  mainly on insects like ants, worms, and caterpillars, foraging
                  on the ground or in bushes. Its standout feature is its rich,
                  flute-like song, often mimicking other birds, making it a
                  favorite among bird enthusiasts. Males are glossy black with a
                  white rump and chestnut belly; females are greyish-brown.
                  Nesting from April to June, it lays 3-4 eggs. Its lifespan is
                  around 7-10 years.

                  The Black Drongo (Dicrurus macrocercus), known as "Finge" in
                  Bangladesh, is a small, glossy black bird with a distinctive
                  forked tail. It inhabits open fields, savannas, and urban
                  areas, often perching on wires or bushes to hunt. Primarily
                  insectivorous, it feeds on grasshoppers, beetles, and bees,
                  catching them mid-air or gleaning from the ground. Its
                  aggressive nature, earning it the name "king crow," involves
                  dive-bombing larger birds to protect its territory. Black
                  Drongos live about 10-12 years and are playful, sometimes
                  dropping leaves to catch them mid-air. They are common, with
                  no major threats.

                  The Mountain Bamboo-Partridge (Bambusicola fytchii), a small
                  bird in the Phasianidae family, inhabits Bangladesh’s bamboo
                  scrub forests, tall grasslands, and degraded forest areas near
                  water. It stays under shrub cover most of the day, foraging
                  for seeds, berries, shoots, buds, grains, insects, and worms
                  in early morning and late evening. Its plumage, a mix of
                  browns, cream, and grey with black-and-white eye stripes,
                  provides excellent camouflage. Breeding occurs from March to
                  September, with females eggs for 18-19 days in simple ground
                  nests. The species, fairly common but declining, lives about
                  5-7 years.

                  Every winter, Siberian ducks migrate to warmer regions,
                  becoming special seasonal guests in many parts of South Asia.
                  These elegant waterfowl travel thousands of kilometers to
                  escape the harsh Siberian cold, settling near wetlands,
                  rivers, and lakes. Their arrival brings life and color to the
                  otherwise quiet water bodies, delighting bird watchers and
                  nature lovers alike. The presence of these ducks is not only a
                  natural spectacle but also a reminder of the importance of
                  conserving habitats. As temporary visitors, they symbolize
                  harmony between nature and wildlife, enriching the
                  biodiversity of their host regions during the chilly winter
                  months.

                  The bar-headed goose is a remarkable bird known for its
                  incredible high-altitude migrations over the Himalayas. Native
                  to Central Asia, these geese can fly at altitudes over 7,000
                  meters, where oxygen levels are dangerously low. Their
                  powerful lungs, efficient oxygen usage, and unique hemoglobin
                  allow them to survive such extreme conditions. Recognized by
                  the two distinctive black bars on their head, they migrate
                  from their wintering grounds in India to breeding sites in
                  Tibet and Central Asia. Bar-headed geese feed on grasses and
                  grains and are often found near lakes and wetlands. Their
                  resilience makes them a marvel of nature.

                  Herons are long-legged, freshwater and coastal birds known for
                  their graceful appearance and patient hunting skills.
                  Belonging to the family Ardeidae, they are found on every
                  continent except Antarctica. These birds typically have long
                  necks and sharp beaks, which they use to catch fish, frogs,
                  and small aquatic animals. Herons are often seen standing
                  still in shallow water, waiting to strike swiftly at their
                  prey. They build large nests in trees, often in colonies
                  called heronries. Species like the great blue heron and the
                  grey heron are well-known. Herons play a vital role in
                  maintaining healthy wetland ecosystems.

                  The Black-tailed Godwit (Limosa limosa) is a large, elegant
                  wading bird known for its long legs and straight bill. It has
                  a striking appearance, with a mix of grey, white, and black
                  plumage in winter, and rich orange-brown tones during breeding
                  season. Native to Europe and Asia, it migrates to Africa,
                  South Asia, and Australia in winter. This species prefers
                  wetlands, marshes, and estuaries for feeding on insects,
                  worms, and small invertebrates. Its numbers have declined due
                  to habitat loss, making it a near-threatened species.
                  Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure its survival and
                  protect its breeding grounds.
