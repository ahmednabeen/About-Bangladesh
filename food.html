          The <b>Foods of Bangladesh</b> are a flavorful journey through
          history, tradition, and culture. At the heart of Bangladeshi meals is
          <b>Rice</b>, often enjoyed with <b>lentils, vegetables</b>, and an
          array of spicy <b>curries</b>. <b>Fish</b>, especially the beloved
          <b>hilsa</b>, is more than just food—it’s a symbol of
          <b>identity and pride</b>. From riverbanks to family feasts, fish
          dishes are essential to daily life. Meat also plays a central role,
          especially during special occasions. Rich dishes like
          <b>beef rezala</b>, <b>mutton korma</b>, and <b>chicken roast</b> are
          favorites during <b>Eid and weddings</b>, filling homes with the warm
          aroma of spices and tradition. Food habits in Bangladesh are deeply
          social. Meals are often shared with family, eaten with the hands, and
          enjoyed together. Snacks are also a big part of daily life—whether
          it’s spicy <b>fuchka</b> on a street corner or a warm cup of
          <b>tea with muri</b> and biscuits on a lazy afternoon.
          <b>Sweets</b> like <b>roshogolla, sandesh</b>, and
          <b>mishti doi</b> aren’t just desserts; they’re tokens of love,
          celebration, and hospitality. The roots of Bangladeshi cuisine trace
          back to ancient and medieval times, shaped by Mughal grandeur and
          local creativity. <b>Mughlai biryani</b> and rich desserts like
          <b>firni</b> remain timeless favorites. Religion has also influenced
          food deeply. <b>During Ramadan</b>, Muslim families break their fast
          with <b>Dates</b>, <b>beguni, piyaju,</b> and <b>jilapi</b>, while
          <b>Hindu</b> households celebrate with <b>vegetarian feasts</b> and
          traditional <b>sweets</b> during <b>pujas</b>. Across the country,
          rice cakes known as <b>pithas</b> bring warmth during winter, often
          handmade with care and shared with neighbors. Despite changes and
          modern influences, Bangladeshi food remains a beautiful reflection of
          its people—warm, vibrant, and rooted in togetherness.

                  Panta Ilish is a traditional Bengali dish that holds deep
                  cultural and emotional significance, especially in Bangladesh.
                  It consists of leftover rice soaked in water overnight, served
                  cold with fried hilsa fish (ilish), onions, green chilies, and
                  sometimes mustard oil. Often enjoyed during the Bengali New
                  Year (Pohela Boishakh), Panta Ilish symbolizes rural
                  simplicity and heritage. The tangy, fermented flavor of the
                  rice pairs perfectly with the rich, oily taste of hilsa. More
                  than just food, it represents Bengali identity, nostalgia, and
                  unity. Despite modern dining trends, this humble yet iconic
                  dish continues to be cherished across generations.

                <p class="card-text">
                  Kacchi Biryani is a beloved Bengali dish, especially popular
                  in festive occasions and weddings. Originating from Mughal
                  cuisine, it features marinated raw mutton layered with
                  fragrant basmati rice, saffron, ghee, and aromatic spices. The
                  dish is slow-cooked in a sealed pot (dum style), allowing the
                  flavors to blend beautifully. Tender meat, spiced rice, and a
                  rich aroma make it irresistible. Often served with salad,
                  yogurt-based raita, and a boiled egg, Kacchi Biryani is more
                  than just food—it's a celebration. In Bangladesh, it holds a
                  special place as a symbol of hospitality, luxury, and
                  tradition in Bengali culinary culture. And they loved it very
                  much.

                  Chingri Malai Curry is a classic Bengali delicacy made with
                  succulent prawns cooked in a rich, creamy coconut milk gravy.
                  Known for its luxurious taste and fragrant spices, the dish
                  combines aromatic garam masala, green chilies, and ginger with
                  the sweetness of coconut, creating a perfect balance of
                  flavors. Traditionally made with large tiger prawns or golda
                  chingri, this curry served on special occasions and pairs best
                  with plain basmati rice. Loved for its smooth texture and
                  subtle heat, Chingri Malai Curry showcases the elegance and
                  depth of Bengali cuisine, blending coastal flavors with royal
                  Mughlai influences.

                  Haleem is a popular and hearty Bengali dish, especially
                  enjoyed during the holy month of Ramadan. It is a slow-cooked
                  stew made with a rich blend of lentils, wheat, barley, and
                  shredded meat—usually beef or mutton—seasoned with aromatic
                  spices like cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves. The dish is thick,
                  savory, and full of flavor, often garnished with fried onions,
                  coriander leaves, lemon, and green chilies. In Bangladesh,
                  haleem is loved for its nourishing quality and is commonly
                  served as an iftar item. It reflects a fusion of Middle
                  Eastern and South Asian culinary traditions, cherished across
                  all communities.

                  Hilsa fish curry, known as "Ilish macher jhol" in Bengali, is
                  a beloved traditional dish in Bengali cuisine. Made with the
                  prized hilsa fish, it is cooked in mustard oil with a blend of
                  turmeric, green chilies, and mustard paste, creating a rich,
                  flavorful gravy. The soft, oily texture of the fish paired
                  with the bold mustard flavor makes it a unique delicacy. Often
                  served with plain white rice, it is especially popular during
                  the monsoon season. Hilsa holds cultural significance in
                  Bengali households, symbolizing celebration and tradition, and
                  is often served during special occasions and family
                  gatherings.

                  Bengali sweets are world-famous for their rich flavors and
                  delicate textures. Made primarily from milk, sugar, and rice
                  flour, these desserts hold a special place in Bengali culture
                  and celebrations. Popular sweets like roshogolla, sandesh, and
                  chomchom are loved for their soft, syrupy sweetness and subtle
                  aromatic hints. Mishti doi, a sweetened yogurt, offers a
                  creamy and tangy delight. These sweets are often served during
                  festivals, weddings, and religious ceremonies, symbolizing joy
                  and hospitality. Bengali sweets are not just desserts but a
                  cherished tradition, reflecting the region’s deep love for
                  food and artistry in sweet-making.

                  Mishti Doi is a classic Bengali dessert made from sweetened
                  fermented yogurt. This creamy, caramel-colored treat is
                  beloved across Bengal for its rich, smooth texture and natural
                  sweetness, often enhanced with jaggery or sugar. Traditionally
                  prepared by boiling milk and allowing it to thicken before
                  adding yogurt culture, Mishti Doi is left to ferment in
                  earthen pots, which give it a unique flavor and aroma. Served
                  chilled, it is a perfect end to any meal and a staple during
                  festivals and celebrations. Its delicate balance of sweetness
                  and tanginess makes Mishti Doi a timeless favorite in Bengali
                  cuisine.

                  Paratha is a popular Bengali flatbread loved for its flaky,

                  curries, lentils, or chutneys. Sometimes, they are stuffed
                  with ingredients like potatoes, cauliflower, or minced meat
                  for added flavor. Paratha’s comforting texture and versatile
                  nature make it a beloved part of Bengali cuisine, bringing

                  Kala Bhuna is a classic Bengali dish known for its deep, rich
                  flavor and dark, almost black color. Made primarily with beef
                  or mutton, the meat is slow-cooked with a blend of spices like
                  cumin, coriander, cloves, cinnamon, and bay leaves, along with
                  mustard oil, which gives the dish its signature smoky aroma.
                  The slow frying process caramelizes the spices and meat,
                  creating a thick, flavorful gravy. Kala Bhuna is a favorite
                  during special occasions and festivals in Bengal, often
                  enjoyed with plain rice or paratha. Its bold taste and tender
                  meat make it a beloved traditional delicacy in Bengali
                  cuisine.

                  Jalebi is a popular sweet treat enjoyed across Bengal and the
                  rest of South Asia. This golden, spiral-shaped dessert is made
                  by deep-frying a fermented batter of flour into crisp, coiled
                  shapes, which are then soaked in sugary syrup. In Bengal,
                  jalebi is often enjoyed during festivals, special occasions,
                  and as a street food favorite. Its crunchy texture combined
                  with the sticky sweetness makes it irresistible. Traditionally
                  served warm, jalebi pairs perfectly with a cup of tea or even
                  with yogurt for a delightful contrast. This beloved sweet
