          <b>Bangladesh</b> is home to a diverse range of `<b>animals</b>,
          enriched by its rivers, forests, hills, and wetlands. The
          <b>National Animal</b> of Bangladesh is the
          <b>Royal Bengal Tiger</b> (Panthera tigris tigris), a majestic and
          powerful creature that symbolizes strength, courage, and pride.
          <b>Found</b> mainly in the <b>Sundarbans</b>,
          <b>the largest mangrove forest in the world</b>, the Royal Bengal
          Tiger is a solitary and territorial predator. It primarily feeds on
          <b>deer</b>, <b>wild boars</b>, and occasionally fish, using stealth
          and power to hunt. This tiger holds a deep place in the cultural
          identity of Bangladesh and appears in literature, folklore, and
          national emblems. Due to habitat loss and poaching, it is now an
          endangered species, and various conservation efforts are underway to
          protect it. Beyond the Royal Bengal Tiger, Bangladesh is home to many
          other remarkable animals. <b>Asian elephants</b> are found in the
          hilly forests of <b>Chittagong and Sylhet</b>. <b>Leopards</b>,
          <b>jungle cats</b>, and <b>fishing cats</b> also inhabit forested
          areas. In the rivers and wetlands, species like the
          <b>Gangetic dolphin</b>, otters, and various freshwater turtles are
          present. The country also has a wide variety of birds, such as the
          Oriental magpie robin (Doel), which is the national bird, and is
          admired for its sweet song. Reptiles such as crocodiles, monitor
          lizards, and snakes also form part of the rich biodiversity. Among all
          these, animals like the Royal Bengal Tiger and Asian elephant are
          considered pride symbols of Bangladesh for their strength, cultural
          value, and unique presence in the region. Preserving these animals is
          vital not just for biodiversity, but for the national heritage of
          Bangladesh. With growing awareness and conservation, there is hope
          that these species will continue to thrive and remain
          <b>symbols of the country’s natural beauty and identity.</b>

                  The Royal Bengal Tiger, the national animal of Bangladesh, is
                  a symbol of strength, courage, and pride for the Bengali
                  people. Found mainly in the Sundarbans mangrove forest, this
                  majestic creature is known for its striking orange coat with
                  bold black stripes. It is one of the largest tiger species in
                  the world and plays a vital role in maintaining the balance of
                  the forest ecosystem. Deeply rooted in Bengali culture and
                  folklore, the Royal Bengal Tiger represents both beauty and
                  power. Today, it faces threats from habitat loss and poaching,
                  making its conservation a national and global priority.

                <p class="card-text">
                  The deer, known as "হরিণ" (horin) in Bengali, is a graceful
                  and gentle animal found in various parts of Bangladesh,
                  especially in the Sundarbans mangrove forest. The most famous
                  species here is the spotted deer or chital, admired for its
                  beautiful white spots and calm nature. Deer are herbivores,
                  feeding on grass, leaves, and fruits. In Bengali culture the
                  deer symbolizes beauty, innocence, and freedom. Sadly, due to
                  habitat loss and poaching, their population is under threat.
                  Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect these elegant
                  animals and preserve their natural habitat in Bangladesh’s
                  forests and wildlife sanctuaries.

                <p class="card-text">
                  The wild boar, known as "bon shukar" in Bengali, is a native
                  animal found in the forests and rural areas of Bangladesh and
                  West Bengal. These strong, stout animals are known for their
                  coarse fur, sharp tusks, and tough nature. Wild boars are
                  omnivorous and forage for roots, fruits, small animals, and
                  crops, often causing conflict with farmers. Though not
                  commonly seen, they play an important role in the ecosystem by
                  helping control insect populations and dispersing seeds. In
                  Bengali folklore, wild boars are symbols of strength and
                  stubbornness, and they hold a unique place in the region’s
                  wildlife heritage.

                  The elephant, known as “hati” in Bengali, holds a special
                  place in the culture and history of Bengal. These majestic
                  animals were once common in the forests of Bangladesh and were
                  traditionally used for royal processions, logging, and
                  ceremonial purposes. Elephants symbolize strength, wisdom, and
                  dignity in Bengali folklore and literature. Although now
                  endangered due to habitat loss and human conflict, wild
                  elephants can still be found in parts of the Chittagong Hill
                  Tracts. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect these
                  gentle giants, who remain an important part of Bengal’s
                  natural heritage and cultural identity.

                <p class="card-text">
                  The leopard, known as **চিতা বাঘ (Chita Bagh)** in Bengali, is
                  a majestic and elusive big cat found in parts of Bangladesh,
                  especially in the Chittagong Hill Tracts and the Sundarbans.
                  It is known for its golden coat covered with black rosettes,
                  stealthy movement, and powerful hunting skills. Leopards are
                  solitary and mainly nocturnal, preying on deer, monkeys, and
                  smaller animals. Though once widespread, their numbers have
                  declined due to habitat loss and human conflict. In Bengali
                  culture, the leopard is both feared and respected, often
                  appearing in folk tales as a symbol of strength, agility, and
                  mystery.

                  The jungle cat, known as “Bon biral” in Bengali, is a wild
                  feline native to the forests, grasslands, and wetlands of
                  Bangladesh. Larger than domestic cats, it has a slender body,
                  long legs, and a short tail with a black tip. Its fur is
                  usually reddish-brown or grey, with faint markings. Jungle
                  cats are solitary and primarily nocturnal, feeding on rodents,
                  birds, and small animals. They play an important role in
                  controlling pest populations. Though adaptable, their numbers
                  are declining due to habitat loss and human interference. In
                  Bengali folklore and rural areas, they are both respected and
                  sometimes misunderstood.

                  Common cats, known as "biral" in Bengali, are a familiar sight
                  in homes and streets across Bangladesh. These domestic cats
                  are usually mixed breeds with short hair, slender bodies, and
                  playful yet independent personalities. They come in various
                  colors like white, black, orange, and grey, often with
                  striking green or yellow eyes. In rural areas, cats are valued
                  for keeping homes free of mice and pests. While some are kept
                  as pets, many live freely and are fed by locals. Cats in
                  Bengali culture are seen as clever and curious animals, often
                  featured in folk tales and childhood stories.

                  Dogs, known as “কুকুর” (kukur) in Bengali, are common and
                  familiar animals in both rural and urban areas of Bangladesh.
                  Traditionally, they have been used as loyal guardians of homes
                  and properties, especially in villages. Though not often kept
                  as pets in the way seen in Western countries, their presence
                  is valued for protection and companionship. Street dogs are a
                  part of daily life, often fed by locals despite limited
                  resources. In recent years, attitudes have begun to shift,
                  with more families adopting dogs as household pets. Known for
                  their loyalty and intelligence, dogs hold a quiet but
                  meaningful place in Bengali life.

                  is the national aquatic animal of Bangladesh. Found in the
                  freshwater rivers of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna, this
                  rare species is blind and navigates using echolocation. It
                  plays a vital role in the river ecosystem and is a symbol of
                  the country’s rich biodiversity. Traditionally respected in
                  Bengali culture, the dolphin is now endangered due to water
                  pollution, habitat loss, and fishing threats. Conservation
                  efforts are underway to protect this gentle creature and
                  ensure the survival of one of South Asia’s most unique and
                  iconic freshwater animals.

                  The King Cobra (*Ophiophagus hannah*) is the world’s longest
                  venomous snake and is found in the forests and hilly regions
                  of Bangladesh, especially in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Known
                  in Bengali as "রাজ গোখরো" (Raj Gokhro), this majestic reptile
                  can grow up to 18 feet in length. It feeds mainly on other
                  snakes, earning its name "Ophiophagus," meaning "snake-eater."
                  Despite its fearsome reputation, it avoids human contact and
                  strikes only when threatened. The King Cobra plays an
                  important role in the ecosystem by controlling snake
                  populations and is respected in local folklore and rural
                  traditions across Bengal.

                <p class="card-text">
                  The Bengal fox, also known as the Indian fox, is a small,
                  slender fox native to the Indian subcontinent, including
                  Bangladesh. It has a distinctive bushy tail with a black tip,
                  large ears, and a reddish-brown coat that helps it blend into
                  dry grasslands and scrub forests. Known for its agility and
                  sharp senses, the Bengal fox is mostly active during the early
                  morning and late evening. It feeds on small mammals, insects,
                  fruits, and birds. Though not endangered, habitat loss and
                  human activity threaten its populations. The Bengal fox holds
                  an important place in local folklore and is a symbol of
                  wildlife diversity in Bengal.

                  The gibbon, known as "Bonor Bandar" in Bengali, is a small,
                  agile primate found in the forests of Bangladesh. Famous for
                  its long arms and swift movements, the gibbon swings
                  gracefully through trees using brachiation. They live in
                  family groups and communicate with loud, melodious calls that
                  echo through the forest. Gibbons mainly eat fruits, leaves,
                  and insects. Sadly, habitat loss and hunting have made them
                  vulnerable in Bangladesh. These gentle creatures play a vital
                  role in forest ecosystems by helping disperse seeds.
                  Protecting gibbons is important to preserve the country’s rich
                  biodiversity and natural heritage.

                  The Gaur, known as the “Bengal ox,” is a majestic wild bovine
                  native to Bangladesh and other parts of South Asia. It is the
                  largest species of wild cattle, with a powerful build, dark
                  brown coat, and distinctive curved horns. Gaurs inhabit dense
                  forests and grasslands, where they graze on grasses, leaves,
                  and fruits. Despite their size, they are gentle herbivores but
                  can be fierce when threatened. Sadly, habitat loss and hunting
                  have made them vulnerable in Bangladesh. The Gaur holds
                  cultural significance and symbolizes strength and resilience
                  in Bengali folklore and traditions. Conservation efforts are
                  vital to protect this magnificent animal.

                  The saltwater crocodile, known as *"loak dola"* in Bengali, is
                  the largest reptile found in Bangladesh. It thrives in the
                  coastal mangrove forests of the Sundarbans, the world’s
                  largest mangrove ecosystem. These powerful predators can grow
                  up to seven meters long and have strong jaws capable of
                  crushing prey. Saltwater crocodiles are excellent swimmers,
                  often seen basking on riverbanks or hiding underwater. They
                  play a vital role in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem
                  by controlling fish and other animal populations. Despite
                  their fearsome reputation, they are a protected species due to
                  habitat loss and human conflict.

                  The Sun Bear, known as **রৌপ্যভালুক** (Roupya Bhaluk) in
                  Bengali, is a small bear native to the tropical forests of
                  Southeast Asia, including parts of Bangladesh. It is easily
                  recognized by its short black fur and a distinctive golden or
                  white patch on its chest, resembling a rising sun. Sun Bears
                  are excellent climbers and spend much time in trees searching
                  for food like insects, fruits, and honey. Despite their shy
                  nature, they play an important role in the forest ecosystem by
                  controlling insect populations and dispersing seeds.
                  Unfortunately, habitat loss and poaching have made Sun Bears a
                  vulnerable species in the wild.

                  The Reticulated Python (*Malayopython reticulatus*) is one of
                  the largest and longest snakes in the world and is found in
                  the forests and wetlands of Bangladesh. Known in Bengali as
                  "অজগর সাপ" (Ajogor shap), it is non-venomous and kills its
                  prey by constriction. Its beautifully patterned skin, with
                  complex geometric designs, gives it the name "reticulated."
                  This snake feeds on birds, mammals, and sometimes even deer.
                  Although feared, it plays a vital role in controlling rodent
                  populations. In rural areas, it is sometimes worshipped or
                  respected due to traditional beliefs. Reticulated pythons are
                  now threatened by habitat loss and hunting.
