          The <b>Fruits of Bangladesh</b> are as vibrant and diverse as its
          culture, offering a rich variety throughout the seasons. The national
          fruit of Bangladesh is the <b>Jackfruit</b>, known for its large size,
          spiky outer skin, and sweet, juicy interior. Jackfruit is not only
          enjoyed ripe as a dessert fruit but also eaten raw in curries. Another
          tropical favorite is the <b>Mango</b>, considered the "king of fruits"
          in Bangladesh. The country produces many varieties such as **Langra**,
          **Himsagar**, and **Fazli**, known for their rich aroma and taste,
          especially during summer. <b>Litchi</b> is another beloved seasonal
          fruit, small and red on the outside with a juicy, white pulp inside.
          Grown mostly in northern districts like Dinajpur, Bangladeshi litchis
          are known for their exceptional sweetness. <b>Banana</b> is available
          year-round and comes in many types like **Sagar kola** and **Sabri
          kola**, often eaten at breakfast or offered in religious rituals.
          <b>Guava</b> , grown mostly during the rainy season, is rich in
          Vitamin C and eaten raw with salt and chili. <b>Papaya</b>, both green
          and ripe, is used widely in cooking and as a digestive fruit.
          <b>Coconut</b> and <b>Watermelon</b> are popular for their cooling
          effects in the hot summer months. <b>Pineapple</b>, especially from
          Sylhet, is another juicy treat, known for its sweetness and flavor.
          Other native fruits include Rose apple, <b>Starfruit</b>, and
          <b>Jujube</b>. Fruit is not just food in Bangladesh; it’s a
          celebration of the land’s fertility and seasonal cycles. Whether
          enjoyed freshly picked, served at festivals, or offered to guests,
          fruits hold a special place in Bangladeshi daily life, representing
          nature's bounty and cultural richness.

                  Jackfruit, known as *kathal* in Bengali, is the national fruit
                  of Bangladesh and holds a special place in Bengali culture and
                  cuisine. It is a large, green, spiky fruit with sweet,
                  golden-yellow flesh inside. In summer, jackfruit trees are
                  seen in villages and homes, heavy with fruit. Eaten both ripe
                  and unripe, jackfruit is highly versatile. Ripe jackfruit is
                  enjoyed as a juicy, fragrant fruit, while the unripe version
                  is cooked as a vegetable in curries. Rich in vitamins and
                  fiber, it is both delicious and nutritious. For many
                  Bangladeshis, jackfruit is a symbol of abundance and rural
                  tradition.

                  often eaten fresh with a sprinkle of salt or chili powder, or
                  made into pickles and juices. Rich in vitamin C and
                  antioxidants, it is both delicious and healthy. In rural
                  Bengal, kamranga trees are commonly found in home gardens,
                  making the fruit a nostalgic part of childhood and local
                  tradition.

                  Jujube, known as *boroi* or *kul* in Bengali, is a popular
                  seasonal fruit in Bangladesh, especially during the winter
                  months. It comes in various varieties, ranging from small,
                  sour ones to larger, sweeter types. The fruit is typically
                  green when unripe and turns brownish-red as it ripens. Jujube
                  is enjoyed fresh, with salt and chili for extra flavor, or
                  made into pickles and dried snacks. Rich in vitamin C and
                  antioxidants, it is both healthy and tasty. Widely grown in
                  rural areas, jujube is deeply rooted in Bengali culture and
                  often associated with childhood memories and local fairs.

                  Cashew nut, known as *kaju* in Bengali, is a popular dry fruit
                  rather than a native Bengali fruit, but it holds a special
                  place in Bengali cuisine and culture. Though not widely grown
                  in Bengal, cashew nuts are imported from other regions and
                  used generously in sweets, curries, and festive dishes. Rich
                  in flavor and nutrients, they are often roasted or fried and
                  served as snacks or garnished over biryanis and desserts like
                  *payesh* and *halwa*. During festivals and weddings, cashew
                  nuts symbolize richness and hospitality. Despite not being
                  locally grown, kaju has become a beloved and luxurious part of
                  Bengali food traditions.

                  fruit widely used in Bangladesh for its tangy flavor and
                  medicinal properties. The brown, pod-like fruit contains a
                  sticky, sour pulp that adds a distinctive taste to many
                  traditional dishes, chutneys, and pickles. In Bengali cuisine,
                  tamarind is often used to enhance the flavor of lentils, fish
                  curries, and snacks like chotpoti and fuchka. It is also
                  enjoyed as a refreshing drink during hot summer days. Rich in
                  vitamins and antioxidants, tamarind is valued not only for its

                  health benefits. The fruit is enjoyed fresh, juiced, or used
                  in salads and desserts. In Bengali households, pomegranate is
                  often given to children and the sick due to its high vitamin C
                  and antioxidant content. Though not native to Bangladesh, it
                  is widely available in markets, especially during the winter.
